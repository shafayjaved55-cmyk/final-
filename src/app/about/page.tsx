                In 2016, Ansar Arshad was a systems lead watching agencies overpromise and underdeliver — scope crept,
                juniors learned on client budgets, and &ldquo;done&rdquo; meant something different to everyone. He
                started Nova with a simple bet: a small team of genuinely senior people, honest timelines and code
                clients fully own would win more work than any pitch deck.

                The bet paid. Our first ten clients came entirely from referrals, and nine of them still work with us
                today. That 98% retention rate isn&apos;t a marketing line — it&apos;s the compounding interest on
                telling a founder their idea needs rethinking before we invoice them for building it.
