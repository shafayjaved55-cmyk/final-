        q: "Can you really cut our cloud bill?",
        a: "Median reduction across our audits is 46%, most of it found in the first two weeks: orphaned resources, over-provisioned instances and wrong storage tiers. We do the audit on a fixed fee — if we can't find savings bigger than the fee, we say so up front.",

        q: "How do you handle security and access?",
        a: "Least-privilege IAM from day one, encrypted everything, and audit logging on every action. We also run quarterly access reviews — because the biggest breach risk is usually a key someone left in a Slack thread.",
